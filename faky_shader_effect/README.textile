h1. fake shader effect for backgrounds

Used at "my old blog":http://old.log.koehr.in and as animated version (with canvas elements) at
"http://blog2.nkoehring.de/":http://blog2.nkoehring.de/

Uses a second effect image to create nice shader-like effects on background images. Unfortunately it
works not as good as I want it to.
